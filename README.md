## PART A
### graph level prediction using GAT/GCN
### Old colab link
#### https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TwLhK565kG9XsSTLOJMCyUd9UcerYjQY

### Updated colab link
#### 
### dataset used : 

### Solution

## PART B
### Node classification using GAT/GCN
#### https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-Fz5a5dlLvqkarfJa6GoFwLly57Y6IE7
### dataset used : CORA

### Solution 
#### The dataset consists of academic publications as the nodes and the citations between them as the links: if publication A cites publication B, then the graph has an edge from A to B. The nodes are classified into one of seven subjects, and our model will learn to predict this subject.

## PART C
### link  prediction of graph
#### https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UGhJTKKhDHS8ZNcBePbNwj_zf1UJ2Jkd#scrollTo=NTCV4H3T01DI
### dataset used : Planetoid(citeseer)

### Solution 
#### The dataset consists of Citation links between the documents. Here in this colab, the function performs the prediction of these links of the citations
